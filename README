NotLogger (Notification Logger)

A very simple app that will output to logcat the package names of
the currently active notifications.

Requires android.permission.ACCESS_NOTIFICATIONS which in turn means
the app must be signed with platform keys and pushed to /system/app/

Included in bin/ is a pre-built apk for CyanogenMod pre-signed with their
platform keys.
